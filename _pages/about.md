Hello,

I'm Ben (also willcodefortea). I write code and take pictures, sometimes things appear here.


I got into programming at university. I was studying physics. The elegance of theories, their derivations and implications fascinated me from an early age, but I never found an area I loved. I found ones I hated sure (looking at you cosmology), but none that I wanted to study further. When we had to do some modelling in C however, I discovered that that same elegance could be found here. In to me, were just puzzles. And people would _pay you_ to do them?!

Count. Me. In.

I've been working in startups for around 10 years, primarily with Python and Typescript. I've been on the Engineering Manager track for a few of those and had to switch up my skillset. [Here's a list](/books-that-might-be-worth-reading/) of ever growing books that helped me out.

You can find me in all the usual places :)
