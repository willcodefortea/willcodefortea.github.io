Hello,

I'm Ben (also willcodefortea). I write code and take pictures, sometimes things appear here.


I got into programming at university while I was studying physics. The elegance of theories, their derivations and implications fascinated me from an early age, but I never found an area I really loved. I found ones I hated sure, (looking at you cosmology), but none that I wanted to study further. When we had to do some modelling in C however, I discovered that that same elegance could be found here. For me, programming is all about that elegance, and the puzzle hidden in the noise. Oh people would _pay you_ to do them?!

Count. Me. In.

I've been working in startups for around 10 years, primarily with Python and Typescript. I've been on the Engineering Manager track for a few of those and had to switch up my skillset. [Here's a list](/books-that-might-be-worth-reading/) of ever growing books that helped me out.

You can find me in all the usual places :)

## Technologies I'm looking to learn in 2023

* Build a compiler
* Professional AWS Solutions Architect (THIS TIME)
* TrueLayer
* Rust
* Cloudflare Workers
* [More things as I think of them]

## Technologies I'm looking to learn in 2022

* GitHub actions ✅
  * Extremely useful and very easy to create CI/CD pipelines
* Smart Contracts
  * Massively lost interest in all things blockchain. The philosophy is great, the reality less so.
* Haskell (finally.)
  * Still not spent time with this, but have leaned into partially-functional approaches in my day to day programming
* Terraform ✅
  * plan + apply with state > cloudformation
* CDK ✅
  * It's fine, but the notion of an imperative language to manage infrastructure gives me the heebie jeebies
* Professional AWS Solutions Architect
  * I've been wanting to tick this box for a few years... Maybe next year.
