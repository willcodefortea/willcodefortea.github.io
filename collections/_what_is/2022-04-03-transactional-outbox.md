excerpt: A transactional outbox is a architecture pattern used to guarantee the sending of events after a mutation has been performed, but only after the data has been committed.

Before we can understand what a Transactional Outbox is, it's important to first understand what a vanilla Transaction is. I may write another of these on those in a more detail, but essentially a transaction is an "all-or-nothing" guarantee. You perform multiple mutations on a system, and either they are all applied successfully, or the system "rolls-back" to the previous state and it's as if nothing happened at all.

For example, let's say Alice has a current account at a bank with $1000 in it. She'd like to begin a savings account so she open another account and moves $100 to it from the first. As a sequence diagram, it might look something like this:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/what-is/transactional-outbox/account-move-success.jpeg" alt="Sequence diagram of a non-transactional money movement." caption="Alice instructs the bank to move her money, which it does in two operations, one to reduce the amount in her current account and another to add it to her savings." %}{: .img-zoom}

But what happens if step 3 fails? The server catches fire, the network is down, someone leans on the power button, any number of things could happen which would result an in _inconsistent state_. Alice would seem to have lost money, with no way to recover!

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/what-is/transactional-outbox/account-move-failure.jpeg" alt="Sequence diagram of a non-transactional money movement that fails." caption="Alice instructs the bank to move her money, this time however the addition of money fails, Alice has lost $100!" %}{: .img-zoom}

Now if the order of these transactions were reversed, Alice probably wouldn't mind too much, she's gained an extra $100 for free! As it stands however, I think she'd be quite annoyed. To solve this, we wrap the two operations in a transaction.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/what-is/transactional-outbox/transaction-account-failure.jpeg" alt="Sequence diagram of a banking transaction that fails." caption="Alice again instructs the bank to move money, and while this time it still fails, she hasn't lost anything as both operations occurred in a transaction." %}{: .img-zoom}

and the code might look something like this:

```python
def move_money(from_account: str, to_account: str, amount: int):
    conn = psycopg2.connect(dsn)
    cursor = conn.cursor()   # starts the transaction
    cursor.execute(
      "UPDATE SET amount=amount + %n WHERE account_id=%n",
      [amount, to_account]
    )
    cursor.execute(
      "UPDATE SET amount=amount - %n WHERE account_id=%n",
      [amount, from_account]
    )
    cursor.commit()  # commits the transaction
```

> The are much nicer ways of doing the above with context managers, I just wanted to be explicit.

Both of these accounts are within the same database, so what we're doing is:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/what-is/transactional-outbox/bank-database-transaction.jpeg" alt="Sequence diagram of a banking transaction talking the database." %}{: .img-zoom}

What's important to understand however, is that any of the steps that speak to the database can fail, including the final commit itself. No matter what happens however, the database ensures that if you don't perform the final commit, no changes occur.

Well that's quite nice. We're relying on our data store's ability to provide transactional safety... but what happens if you need to perform updates across distinct systems where such this isn't guaranteed? Maybe we'd like to send a notification that the operation was successful, something outside of our data store? But we'd only want to do that if we successfully

Enter, the transactional outbox.

## Multi-phase operations (sending a notification)

Performing multiple actions within the confines of a transaction is nice easy to do, but as soon as we step outside it we are open to problems. It's important to remember when designing systems like this that any operation that can fail, will eventually do so, how will your system recover? If we wanted to send the notification inside the transactional block, but the transaction fails to finish, then we would have sent a notification but the transaction would have rolled back: the user would be told a change had occurred when in reality it wouldn't have.

> Any operation that _can_ fail, will eventually do so

Secondly, it's important to ask ourselves the importance of these operations in terms of their consistency. When moving money from one account to another, it makes sense for this to be _strongly consistent_, that both changes are performed simultaneously. But does the notification? Can that happen after? It seems that it doesn't really matter too much _when_ the user receives the notification as long as it's within a few minutes, just that they do so after it's occurred, it can be _eventually consistent_.

Sending a notification is very different to storing data in a database, what would happen if we were to attempt to send one directly?

```python
def move_money_and_send_notification(
  from_account: str,
  to_account: str,
  amount: int,
  user: str
):
    conn = psycopg2.connect(dsn)
    cursor = conn.cursor()   # starts the transaction
    cursor.execute(
      "UPDATE SET amount=amount + %n WHERE account_id=%n",
      [amount, to_account]
    )
    cursor.execute(
      "UPDATE SET amount=amount - %n WHERE account_id=%n",
      [amount, from_account]
    )

    # let the user know their money has been moved
    send_notification("Money moved!", user)

    cursor.commit()  # commit
```

The above example looks like it'll work, if we fail to send the notification the the transaction will error, and roll back. But what if the commit itself fails? In this case we'll have sent Alice a notification that the money has been moved, but nothing will have actually changed. Which is confusing, and annoying.

Instead, what if we recorded the fact a notification needed to be sent, and another system looked for them independently?

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/what-is/transactional-outbox/transaction-account-notification.jpeg" alt="Sequence diagram of a notification being sent." %}{: .img-zoom}

or as code:

```python
def move_money(from_account, to_account, amount, user):
    conn = psycopg2.connect(dsn)
    cursor = conn.cursor()   # starts the transaction
    cursor.execute(
      "UPDATE accounts SET amount=amount + %n WHERE account_id=%n",
      [amount, to_account]
    )
    cursor.execute(
      "UPDATE accounts SET amount=amount - %n WHERE account_id=%n",
      [amount, from_account]
    )
    cursor.execute(
      """"
      INSERT INTO notifications (user, message, sent)
      VALUES ("Success!", %s, False)
      """,
      [user]
    )
    cursor.commit()  # commits the transaction
```

Then an independent operation polls this table looking for notifications to send (you might call this a message relay):

```python
def find_and_send_pending_notifications():
    conn = psycopg2.connect(dsn)
    cur.execute(
      "SELECT id, message, user FROM notifications WHERE sent=False"
    )
    sent_ids = []
    for row_id, message, user in cur.fetchall():
      send_notification(message, user)
      sent_ids.append(row_id)

    cur.executemany(
      "UPDATE notifications SET sent=True WHERE id=%s", send_ids
    )
```

Great! We've decoupled the two operations while guaranteeing that the second one _will_ occur, it just won't occur straight away. The downside in the above example is of course that if we fail to mark them as sent then we'll repeatedly notify the user. This is an example of at-least-once delivery.

And there we have it! A transactional outbox is a pattern used to guarantee that operations performed on distinct services will occur.
